                            add the numbers using the plus operator and return the sum )

                            <code>an algorithm should be language independent</code> i.e it should be written in such a
                            way that it
                            can be used with different programming languages

            <h2>JavaScript Algorithms - 3 - Time and Space Complexity</h2>
            <pre>
    The measure of an algorithm depends on a number of factors,
        -it can change based on the programming language used to implement the algorithm
        -the computer program runs on 
        -the other programs running at the same time
        -the quality of the operating system and many other factors

    So that's why we evaluate(measure) the performance of an algorithm in terms of its 
        <code>Time complexity</code>: which is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of input size
        <code>Space complexity</code>: which is the amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run as function a of input size

</pre>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>When and How to consider the complexity?</h3>
                    <pre>
    one algorithm can be faster for a small input size but slower for a larger input size.
    if your app needs to be very quick and has plenty of memory to work with you should think about time complexity and don't have to worry about space complexity
    on the other hand if you have little memory to work with you should think about space complexity and don't have to worry about time complexity

                <li>
                    <h3>How do we represent the time and space complexity?</h3>
                    <pre>
    we represent the time and space complexity using asymptotic notations (asymptotic notations are mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity)
    there are mainly three asymptotic notations

    let's calculate the number of times each statement is executed, 
        -line two executes only once
        -line four however executes <b> n </b> times 
        -line 6 again is executed just once 
    so the total count is <b> n </b> plus 2. But as far as we know <b>algorithm</b> focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute new details due to this the <b>O(n)-Notation</b> is used to describe the performance of an algorithm.
